# Meme Generator

* My first react app created from scratch. (src: https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/). 
* As of now the, app is very basic and can only render texts on top and bottom of the image. Also, there is no option to download the image, so you might need to take screenshot of the meme :).

### Deployed at

[Meme-Generator](https://meme-generator-godlysubset27.netlify.app/)
* For a better UX, opening on mobile phone is recommended.

## Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
